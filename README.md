# github_jobPages
This app uses the github jobs api to get data of various job openings, it uses react-bootstrap for styling, this app uses pagenation as well, it also has a search form, using which you can search for jobs. If you run it on your machine you might get a CORS error, i have added a comment in the app.js which will help you.
