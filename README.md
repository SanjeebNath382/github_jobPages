# github_jobPages
This App uses the github jobs API to get data of various job openings. The App uses react-bootstrap for styling. This App also uses pagenation and has a search form, using which you can search for jobs. If you run it on your machine, you might get a CORS error, I have added a comment in the app.js which will help you out.
